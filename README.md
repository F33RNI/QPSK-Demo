# ðŸ“¡ QPSK-Demo
### Demonstration of a QPSK modulator / demodulator in the audio range (with the ability to run it through a real speaker / mic)

### Block diagram of modulator section:

### Block diagram of demodulator section:

As you can see, I'm using a Costas Loop with a PI (Proportional-Integrator controller) to control the local oscillator

----------

The screenshot at the top shows an example of a "Hello!" message.

`TX_DATA`:
```python
# [-1] - Silence,
# [0] * 60 - PLL sync burst,
# [0, 1, 2, 3] - phase (IQ) sync (MUST BE EXACTLY THESE VALUES IN THIS ORDER),
# string_to_qpsk_array("Hello!") - Data (payload),
# [-1] * 20 - Silence
TX_DATA = [-1] + [0] * 60 + [0, 1, 2, 3] + string_to_qpsk_array("Hello!") + [-1] * 20
```

### To test transmission using your speaker and microphone:

1. Install the PyAudio package
2. Ensure that your sound card supports the float32 format and the values of `CHUNK_SIZE` and `SAMPLING_RATE`
3. Set `USE_LINE_SIMULATION` to `False`
4. Make sure your speaker and microphone are selected as the default devices in your system
5. Place the microphone near the speaker and create a quiet environment
6. Run the script. You should hear the transmission. If the sound level is set correctly, you will see a message indicating the start and end of recording
